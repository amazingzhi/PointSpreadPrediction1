# PointSpreadPrediction1
Hi everybody, this is a documentation on how to replicate my research.
1. download everything from this Project (all .py files and requirment file).
2. download all data from my google drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11hj3LifzEtTsbzNE0pXmAX07Ice82xVr)
3. put data folder into the project file you download
4. execute files from game_feature_extraction (get all important game features to predict point spread)
5. execute files from player_PM_prediction (use player data to predict player performance for each game and concatenate player performance with team features)
6. execute files from game_player_prediction (use concatenated team and player features to predict point spread and simulate profits and returns)
